The structure is mainly composed by steel moment frames as well as some minor concrete shear walls which despite being mostly an architectural detail, were used to stiffen the structure to avoid torsional modes. I was mainly tasked with generating the detailing model as well as producing the shop drawings. This was the first building being produced and assembled by the company I was working for at the moment.<br><br><br><span class="secondary-title">CODES APPLIED:</span> ASCE, AISC, AISI, ACI.
