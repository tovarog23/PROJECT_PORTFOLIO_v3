The tower, with a total of 23 levels, will consist of a dual system of moment frames and concrete shear walls. In this case, I was involved in the bid and predesign stage of the project. I was responsible for generating a series of linear dynamic elastic analysis of the building structure using different systems in order to determine which one would be the most suitable option. Two main options were considered, including the use of moment steel frames with concentric braces along the height of the building or the use of the previously mentioned concrete dual system, which ended up being the selected option. <br><br><br><span class="secondary-title">CODES APPLIED:</span> ASCE, AISC, AISI, ACI.
