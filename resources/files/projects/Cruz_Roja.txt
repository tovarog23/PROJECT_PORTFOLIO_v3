In this particular project, I participated as a freelance BIM manager for a local engineering and construction consultancy (Montreal Infraestructura). The project consisted of a small building extension to be added to an educational facility for the Red Cross organization in Queretaro. I was in charge of creating a BIM model in REVIT to track construction phases and progress as well as to obtain precise material takeoffs to reduce overcosts.
