The challenge consisted in using any software application from MIDAS in a complex manner to achieve a specific structural task or challenge. In this case, MIDAS Gen was used to analyze and compare the behaviour of a regular skyscraper structure with a twisted irregular design. Both wind and seismic loads were considered as well, as well as a main structure composed by steel framing and a supercore of reinforced concrete. My team and I, representing the Monterrey Instutite of Technology and Higher Education, achieved second place in the international challenge.
