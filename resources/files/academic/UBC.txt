The task consisted in analyzing a reinforced concrete masonry wall structure and designing two of the shear walls under the effects of gravity and seismic loads according to the latest version of the NBCC and CSA standards. A capacity design approach was used and the wall was detailed according to the level of ductility expected from the walls.
