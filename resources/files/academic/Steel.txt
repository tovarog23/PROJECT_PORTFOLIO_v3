Architectural plans were given and a steel framing system was proposed. In this case, only moment frames were used with a limited equivalent force procedure seismic analysis. The building was designed using the AISC standards as well as the local NTC-2017 mexican code. The seismic coefficient from the zone of Queretaro was used, leading to modest seismic loads.
